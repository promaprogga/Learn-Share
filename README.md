# Learn-Share
Learn and share is an online learning, communication, and sharing 
platform. In this project, we tried to add several features from which a 
student can be benefited. They can take part in the quiz on various topics 
and get the result after the exam. Students can share notes with others. If 
any student is stuck at any point, he or she can ask the question in the 
discussion section and others can reply to clear the confusion. In the 
learning feed, they will get video tutorials on various topics and also 
upload tutorials of their own. They can find useful books which are 
published by the admin in the ebook section. Admin will post important 
information on various topics in the blog section.
